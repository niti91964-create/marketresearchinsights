# Why do most research firms fall short on depth, while Next Move Strategy Consulting delivers truly actionable insights?
The [Hybrid Train Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/hybrid-train-market-at3071) report from Next Move Strategy Consulting immediately felt different from the usual research out there. What impressed me most was the way it goes beyond surface-level numbers with a detailed company-level market share breakdown for 10 players.

This depth gives a much clearer picture of the competitive landscape, making strategy and benchmarking far more effective. Compared to other firms, Next Move sets a higher bar by delivering insights that are both transparent and genuinely useful.
